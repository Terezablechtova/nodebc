        As night falls on Hogsmeade village, “The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle” shines brightly with an
        awe-inspiring spectacle that showcases the four houses of Hogwarts: <strong>Gryffindor</strong>, Ravenclaw,
        Hufflepuff and Slytherin and culminates with awesome beams of lights that fan into the night sky.
        The colorful state-of-the-art light display and special effects projection is accompanied by a special musical
        arrangement created by Academy Award-winning composer <strong>John Williams</strong> based on his original scores
        composed for the film series. The musical arrangement that emanates in a surround sound environment was
        conducted by prolific arranger William Ross and recorded by the <strong>London Symphony Orchestra</strong> in
        London.
